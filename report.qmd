## Introduction

This report analyzes key economic and social indicators for different countries using the World Development Indicators dataset (2022). The analysis explores **GDP per capita, life expectancy**, and **unemployment rates**, providing insights into global trends.

The dataset is sourced from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/). 


```{python}
#| echo: true

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("wdi.csv")
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Descriptive Statistics

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| label: tbl-stats
#| tbl-cap: Descriptive Statistics of Selected Indicators (2022) <br> Source [@worldbankdata].

desc_stats = df[['gdp_per_capita','life_expectancy','unemployment_rate']].describe()
table_data = []
for stat_name in desc_stats.index:  
    row = []
    row.append(stat_name.capitalize()) 
    gdp_val = desc_stats.loc[stat_name, 'gdp_per_capita']
    life_val = desc_stats.loc[stat_name, 'life_expectancy']
    unemp_val = desc_stats.loc[stat_name, 'unemployment_rate']
    row.append(f"{gdp_val:,.2f}")    
    row.append(f"{life_val:,.2f}")   
    row.append(f"{unemp_val:,.2f}")  
    table_data.append(row)

column_labels = ["Statistic", "GDP per Capita", "Life Expectancy", "Unemployment Rate"]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 4))
ax.set_axis_off()
table = ax.table(
    cellText=table_data,
    colLabels=column_labels,
    loc='center',
    cellLoc='center'
)

ncols = len(column_labels)
for col_index in range(ncols):
    header_cell = table[0, col_index]
    header_cell.set_facecolor('#000080')  
    header_cell.set_text_props(weight='bold', color='white', fontsize = 14)

for row_index in range(1, len(table_data) + 1):
    for col_index in range(ncols):
        data_cell = table[row_index, col_index]
        data_cell.set_text_props(fontsize=12)

table.scale(1, 1.4) 
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

@tbl-stats highlights substantial global disparities in the chosen metrics. On average, countries have a GDP per capita of around $20,000, though a small subset of very high-income countries skews this figure upward, with values ranging from roughly $259 to $241,000. Average life expectancy is about 72 years (with a spread of 53 to 85 years), while unemployment rates average 7.27% but range widely from 0.13% up to 37.85%. Overall, these statistics underscore substantial differences in economic well-being, health outcomes, and labor market conditions across countries.


### GDP per Capita Distribution
The extremely wide range in GDP per capita suggests a highly skewed distribution—many countries sit at lower income levels, while a few outliers pull the global mean upward. To understand this spread more clearly, let's visualize how GDP per capita is distributed.


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-gdp
#| fig-cap: |
#|  GDP per Capita Distribution
#|  <br>
#|  Source: [@worldbankdata].

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.histplot(df["gdp_per_capita"].dropna(), bins=30, kde=True, color="#000080")
plt.xlabel("GDP per Capita (USD)")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.title("Distribution of GDP per Capita (2022)")
plt.show()
```

@fig-gdp confirms that GDP per capita is heavily skewed to the right: most countries fall under lower income brackets, while a small number of outliers extend well above $100,000 and push the overall mean upward. This substantial skew implies that median values are likely more representative of typical country incomes than the mean.


### GDP vs. Life Expectancy
Given this pronounced disparity in economic well-being, let's examine how GDP per capita might correlate with other development outcomes—beginning with life expectancy.

```{python}
#| label: fig-gdp-life
#| fig-cap: |
#|  GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy
#|  <br>
#|  Source: [@worldbankdata].
#| echo: false


df["log_population"] = np.log(df["total_population"])

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
scatter = sns.scatterplot(
    data=df, 
    x="gdp_per_capita", 
    y="life_expectancy", 
    hue="log_population", 
    alpha=0.7,
    palette="Blues", 
    legend = "brief"
)
plt.xlabel("GDP per Capita (USD)")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy (Years)")
plt.title("GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy (2022)")
handles, labels = scatter.get_legend_handles_labels()
plt.legend(handles, labels, title="Log of Population", loc="best")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

@fig-gdp-life shows a strong positive relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy, with significant gains in lifespan as income increases up to around $30,000–$40,000. Beyond that threshold, additional wealth yields diminishing returns on longevity, and many of the world’s most populous nations remain in lower-to-mid income brackets.

### Unemployment Rate 
Given this connection between economic well-being and life expectancy, let's explore how labor market conditions factor into a country's overall development profile. In this section, we shift our focus to unemployment rates, examining how they vary globally.


```{python}
#| label: fig-unemp
#| fig-cap: |
#|  Unemployment Rate by Country (2022)
#|  <br>
#|  Source: [@worldbankdata].
#| echo: false

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.histplot(df["unemployment_rate"].dropna(), bins=20, kde=True, color="#000080")
plt.xlabel("Unemployment Rate (%)")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.title("Distribution of Unemployment Rates (2022)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

As shown in @fig-unemp, countries appear to cluster below roughly 10% unemployment, with a peak around the low-mid single digits. A long right tail extends past 20% to as high as 35%, indicating that a smaller subset of countries faces significantly higher unemployment rates.

## Conclusion

Overall, these findings reinforce the global disparities in economic development and social outcomes. A small group of high-income nations pushes the average GDP per capita upward, while most countries cluster well below that threshold. Wealth does appear to improve life expectancy up to a point, but the benefits level off beyond roughly $40,000 in GDP per capita. Meanwhile, most economies maintain single-digit unemployment rates, though a few nations face challenges above 20%. Together, these results underscore the need for targeted policy interventions, particularly for populations in lower-to-middle income and high-unemployment environments.
